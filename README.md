# Our-Local-Society

This is my new project, Our Local Society(OLS) website is an application that is developed using Rails in both front-end and back-end as a first step, this application solve a problem on my faculty which is Faculty of Computers and Information, the problem is that it is not allowed to us to use Facebook or Twitter inside the University, So sometimes i can not reach my friends or where they are, sometimes there phones are turned off or run out of charge, So i decided to make something that each person can put his schedule of his day and each person can see his schedule (his lectures, sections and labs time) to know if he busy right now or not, the second target is that i want to get better in using rails and making websites, i wish you like it.
